## 📊 KPI Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard starts with key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide a quick snapshot of Uber's operational metrics:

- 🔢 **Total Bookings**
- 💰 **Total Booking Value**
- 📏 **Average Trip Distance**
- 💵 **Average Booking Value**
- 🛣️ **Total Trip Distance**

These KPIs update dynamically based on filters like time, location, and vehicle type.

**Insight:** While most trips are short-distance, the volume of rides contributes to a high cumulative booking value. SUVs, despite lower volume, deliver higher average revenue per trip.
